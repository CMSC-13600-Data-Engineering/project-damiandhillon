To design the data model for the AttendanceChimp project, we need to outline the entities (tables) involved and their relationships. Given the requirements, we can identify the following key entities and relationships:
Users: This entity represents both students and instructors. It will use Djangoâ€™s built-in user model to handle authentication and basic user information.
Roles: While Django's user model covers the basic authentication, we need a way to differentiate between students and instructors.
Courses: This entity represents the courses that instructors can create and students can join.
AttendanceSessions: Each course session that requires attendance will have a unique QR code generated by the instructor. This entity represents those sessions.
AttendanceRecords: This entity tracks the QR codes uploaded by students, associating them with a particular attendance session.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of each entity and their fields:

1. Users
    - ID (AutoField): A unique identifier for each user.
    - Username (CharField): The user's chosen username.
    - Email (EmailField): The user's email address.
    - Password (CharField): Hashed password for authentication.
Note: We will utilize Django's built-in User model for this, which already includes these fields and more.

2. Roles
    - User_ID (ForeignKey to Users): Links to the Django user.
    - Role_Type (CharField): Differentiates between "Student" and "Instructor".
3. Courses
    - ID (AutoField): Unique identifier for each course.
    - Title (CharField): The name of the course.
    - Instructor_ID (ForeignKey to Users): References the instructor teaching the course.
4. AttendanceSessions
    - ID (AutoField): Unique identifier for each session.
    - Course_ID (ForeignKey to Courses): The course this session belongs to.
    - Session_Date (DateTimeField): The date and time the session takes place.
    - QR_Code (TextField): The unique QR code generated for this session.
5. AttendanceRecords
    - ID (AutoField): Unique identifier for each record.
    - Session_ID (ForeignKey to AttendanceSessions): The session this record belongs to.
    - Student_ID (ForeignKey to Users): The student who uploaded the QR code.
    - Upload_Time (DateTimeField): The date and time the QR code was uploaded.
Relationships:
    - A User can have multiple Roles (but typically will have just one indicating if they are a student or an instructor).
    - An Instructor can create multiple Courses.
    - A Course can have multiple AttendanceSessions.
    - A Session can have multiple AttendanceRecords, but each Record is linked to one Student.
This structure supports the core functionality of AttendanceChimp, including user management, course management, generating and uploading QR codes for attendance tracking, and differentiating user roles.

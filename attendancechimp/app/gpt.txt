The GPT model combines the student and instructor tables into one called user, which simplifies the model.
It introduced a course participation table, which builds on the enrollment table, but this time tracking completion and dropping of courses.
It also combined QR code and attendance records into one single table.
It overall had the same completeness, but less tables and simpler relationships. 
But I feel having seperate tables for QR and attendance can be benefitial in the future if we want to make changes about how our data is handled.
